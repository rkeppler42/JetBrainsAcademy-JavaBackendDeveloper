# Tasks

## Task 1:

### Description

You've recently opened a new corner shop. It is relatively small; it contains only a bubblegum, toffee, ice cream, milk chocolate, doughnuts, and pancakes. The first version of the program will display a list of all the products with their prices.

### Objectives

- Print the ```Prices:``` line;
- Print the item names and prices. Your output format should follow it.

## Task 2:

### Description

A month has passed since the opening of your shop. Let's calculate the total earnings for this period! You know the total earned amount for each item:

|     Item name | Earned amount |
|--------------:|--------------:|
|      Bubblegum|           $202|
|         Toffee|           $118|
|      Ice cream|          $2250|
| Milk chocolate|          $1680|
|       Doughnut|	         $1075|
|        Pancake|            $80|

Use it and find the total income in the first month.

### Objectives

In this stage, your program should:

1. Print the ```Earned amount:``` line.
2. Print the item names and the earned amount for each of them;
3. Print the total earnings as shown below. Replace ```0.0``` with the actual total sum:

```
Income: $0.0
```

## Task 3

### Description

In the final stage, let's calculate the shop's net income. To do this, you need to retrieve staff and other expenses from the user input and subtract them from the income you came up with in the previous stage.

You don't need to change the previous functionality of your program, but to expand it by adding both inputs and calculating the net income.

### Objectives

In this stage, your program should:

1. Print the item names, what you earned for each of them and total earnings as before;
2. sk users for staff expenses with the ```Staff expenses:``` string and for other expenses with the ```Other expenses:``` string;
3. Calculate and print the net income as shown below. Replace ```0.0``` with the actual net income:

```
Net income: $0.0
```
